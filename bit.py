# rightshift shifting a number by one place equals dividing the number by 2

# given an array of number where each element appears even number of times except for one. Find that Element
# XOR of all the numbers equals that number

# check if kth bit is set of num
# num & (1 << k)

# bitwise AND (&) can be used to check if the ith bit is set, how bitwise OR (|) can be used to set the ith bit, and how bitwise XOR (^) can be used to unset the ith bit.

# to get a bitmask of size n with all 1
# (1 << n) - 1
